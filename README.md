#Smart-Blind-Stick
Smart Blind Stick along with ArduinoUNO to help a person to detect the object from a certain distance.
The smart stick system for assisting blind people . Visually impaired people use stick to find difficulties in detecting obstacles and danger in front of them during walking and to identify the world around .
To overcome the problem here is the device which is used to detect the any object using ultrasonic sensor and arduino.

# Materials Required : 
  1. ArduinoUNO
  2. Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
  3. Buzzer and LED .
  4. Vibrator 
  5. Battery connector and jumper wires
  6. 9V Battery.
  7. Stick.
  8. Other materials like : glue,tape etc........

  9. # Cicuit Diagram :

# Arduino Blind Stick in Action :
Make sure the connections are done as per the circuit diagram and the program is succesfully uploaded .Now ,power both the circuit using  a 9v battery and you should start to see results .Move the ultra sonic sensor closer to any object  and you will notice the buzzer beeping sound and vibration of the stick .
note:- this program is written in C++ language
